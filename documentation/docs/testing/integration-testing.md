# Integration tests

Integration testing is known as the second level of software testing process, following unit testing. Usually a software project consists of numerous software modules built by multiple developers on a team. An integration test challenges how well these separate elements work together to deliver a working product. Integration tests will be used to ensure that connecting features together does not cause issues.

Using the bottom up method of integration testing the lower level modules are the first ones to be tested. The key level in our system is the api calling that retrieves the stock data.
