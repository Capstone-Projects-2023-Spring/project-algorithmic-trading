# Version Control
Version Control

Git will be used for version control. The projectâ€™s repository will be hosted on GitHub. The main branch will be protected, meaning that pushes cannot be made directly to it. Development must be done in a separate branch, and then a pull request must be opened to merge the development branch with the main branch. Pull request approval will be locked behind code reviews, meaning that a developer other than the one who wrote the code must review it and approve of it. For the purposes of this project, 1 or 2 code reviews may be required to increase the chance of having high-quality code.
